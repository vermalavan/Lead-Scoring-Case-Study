# Lead Scoring Assignment


## Data Cleaning
- [x] Handle the "Select" level
- [x] Drop columns with high missing percent.
- [x] Check the number of the unique counts in categorical columns
  - Levels only till 95% cumulative proportion, above that club into "others" (this is called reducing dimensionality)
- [ ] Imputation if low percent missing - mean/median/mode ?
- [x] Find rows retained.

##  Modelling
- RFE for variable selection
- Build a logistic regression model with good sensitivity => Recall of 80% or more.
- Check p-value and VIF
- Find Optimal probability cutoff - ROC Curve or Precision Recall
- Check Model performance over Test Data - (Confusion Matrix, Sensitivity, F1 Scores)
- Generate Score variable - Predict prob * 100
- Aiming for around 80% conversion rate.
